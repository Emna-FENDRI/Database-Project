# EPFL CS-322 Database-Project

## Dataset
You can find the dataset here (.zip file, ~191MB): [parties2018.csv and victims2018.csv](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/VKsJDwreSk6QITN)


## Description
In this project we get two csv files collected by the California Highway Patrol, based on which we   
1. Design the database schema and implement the relational schema.
2. Parse, clean, and load the data into a DBMS.
3. Write queries, and, finally evaluate and optimize queries with index structures/query plan analysis in order to analyze the performance impact on generated query plans and discuss about the query optimizer decisions on querying the given dataset.

In the report, we provide a detailed description of the SQL queries and explain the necessities of indexes based on the queries and the resulting optimization.
